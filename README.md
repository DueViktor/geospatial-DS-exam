# Estimating Above-Ground Biomass in the Finish Forests using satelite imagery and machine learning

Exam project in the course "Geospatial Data Science" Spring 2023. Project was developed by Aske Schytt Meineche and Viktor Due Pedersen.

## Training folder

Training this model is a process that takes a long time. Therefore, we have included the trained model in the repository under `model_outputs`. For the same reason, we haven't included any data but instead provided instructions on how to download the data used in this project in `biomassters-download-instructions.txt`.

## Presentation_notebook

This is the file that takes care of all the evaluation and presentation of the results. It is a jupyter notebook that can be run from top to bottom. It will then produce all the figures and tables used in the report.
